/**
 * Public feature suggestions (2.26.0, issue #32; REQUIREMENTS.md "Approved public-suggestion
 * amendments (2026-09-25)"): `/suggest idea:…` opens an issue in TaruBot's public repository at
 * once, as the TaruBot GitHub App, and replies with its link. The owner moderates afterwards.
 *
 * Who: anyone holding the server's Member or Guest role, and only in the Free Company server this
 * deployment serves (production's allowlist, or DevBot's test guild), so a server that merely
 * invites the bot can't post. What goes public: the member's cleaned text and TaruBot's version,
 * nothing else (src/domain/suggestions.ts). Limits: one per member per hour, three per member and
 * ten in total per day, counted from the audit table; an attempt GitHub didn't confirm counts too.
 *
 * Unlike /issue, nothing is saved first: an idea is easy to retype, and posting in the request the
 * router already deferred needs no table, job or migration. Submissions run one at a time in this
 * process (only the writer-lease holder serves interactions), so the limits are exact without
 * holding a database connection across the GitHub calls. Shutdown drains them before the lease is
 * handed over (`drain`), so a post still at GitHub records its row before the next writer counts.
