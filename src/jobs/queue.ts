 *
 * enqueue() only coalesces into queued, running or blocked rows (the active_job index), so a key
 * enqueued again while its row sat `disabled` gets a second row, and several parked rows can

 * the rest close as succeeded with {skipped: "superseded"}, because the surviving row runs the
 * same work with the newest payload. A closed row keeps its `applied` list (reconcile.user's
 * record of role changes Discord actually received), and each sync run that tracked it tracks the
 * row that now carries its key instead, so the run never reports Completed before that work runs.
 * Losers close first, since a parked `blocked` row is itself in the index. Returns the requeued
 * job IDs.
 *
 * It needs a transaction client: the pair runs inside a savepoint, so a concurrent enqueue that
 * commits an active row for the same key between the two statements (a `disabled` row sits outside
 * active_job, so nothing blocks it) is retried rather than failing the caller's transaction.
