# Version history

The current application version is **2.7.1**, with `package.json` as the source of truth. This codebase is a complete rewrite of the original TaruBot and therefore belongs to major version **2**. `/version` reads the manifest included in its compiled build and obtains commit history independently from GitHub's `main` branch.

## 2.7.1 — Versioning policy and delivery readiness

- Require an appropriate SemVer increment for every coherent change set, including documentation, tests, and maintenance.
- Present required Discord intents and bot permissions as name/reason tables in the setup guide.
- Record the requirements-backed implementation gaps, live acceptance checks, and production-delivery work in `docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md`.
- Record live version-command registration and GitHub signature/history verification.

## 2.7.0 — Version and GitHub history command

- Add `/version [commits]` for any human guild member; show five commits by default, up to ten.
- Show the installed SemVer, linked short commit IDs, and commit titles.
- Mark signed commits with **✅** only when GitHub reports a valid verified signature.
- Share/cache bounded GitHub requests, and retain version output during GitHub outages or rate limits.

## Retrospective development milestones

These numbers are assigned now to the completed work stages to establish a meaningful SemVer baseline. Earlier working snapshots used the placeholder `1.0.0`; these entries describe development milestones, not previously published releases or tags.

| Version | Completed milestone |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0.0 | Core rewrite: ownership, membership, nicknames, guest workflow, ledger, PostgreSQL import/recovery, and containers |
| 2.1.0 | Dynamically discovered commands, events, components, and typed service injection |
| 2.2.0 | Independent Nodestone/selector HEAD tracking and checked update workflow |
| 2.3.0 | Role setup, officer/leader rank projection, explicit officer overrides, and startup test plans |
| 2.4.0 | Public development-guild interaction replies |
| 2.5.0 | Automatic role grouping and hierarchy reconciliation |
| 2.5.1 | Correct consecutive role blocks and reuse of existing Member/Guest role IDs |
| 2.6.0 | Nodestone submodule-backed builds, source fingerprints, and clean-clone verification |
| 2.7.0 | Installed-version and verified GitHub commit-history command |
| 2.7.1 | Mandatory version increments and delivery-readiness tracking |

## Increment policy

- **Major:** incompatible changes to supported commands, configuration, or persisted-data contracts.
- **Minor:** backward-compatible functionality and supported operational capabilities.
- **Patch:** backward-compatible corrections or maintenance, including documentation, tests, and tooling changes without a new feature contract.
- Every coherent change set receives an appropriate version increment; related edits share that increment.

Future changes update `package.json`, the Bun-generated lockfile when affected, and this changelog together. Released versions identify the running build; the latest GitHub commits can include work newer than that build.
