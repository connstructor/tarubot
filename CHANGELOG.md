# Version history

The current application version is **2.12.2**, with `package.json` as the source of truth. This codebase is a complete rewrite of the original TaruBot and therefore belongs to major version **2**. `/version` reads the manifest included in its compiled build and obtains commit history independently from GitHub's `main` branch.

## 2.12.2 — Workflow and code-scanning hardening

- Release the Claude Code workflows added in PR #8, which merged without the required version increment and so left `main` unpublished.
- Pin `anthropics/claude-code-action` v1.0.231 and `actions/checkout` v7.0.1 by commit SHA in the Claude assistant and review workflows, resolving code-scanning alerts #3 and #4. Start `@claude` runs only for owner/member/collaborator mentions, drop the idle assignment trigger, skip fork review events, queue requests per issue or PR, and commit through the API so assistant commits are verified.
- Review only ready, same-repository PRs to `main` started by people; cancel superseded reviews, bound both jobs with timeouts, keep `GITHUB_TOKEN` read-only, and stop persisting checkout credentials.
- Remove CodeQL's experimental `analysis-kinds` input, which was ignored, logged errors, and will become fatal; run the `code-quality` query suite through code scanning instead, since GitHub Code Quality is unavailable for this repository. Record the exact CodeQL action version and let main/scheduled analyses finish instead of cancelling them.
- Make Lodestone tag stripping an explicit fixed point with identical output, resolving high-severity alert #1, and document that display text is not HTML-safe. Add direct `display()` tests.
- Replace the template Dependabot config with Bun, Bun runtime image, Compose PostgreSQL, and grouped GitHub Actions updates with cooldowns, excluding Nodestone-managed dependencies and PostgreSQL majors. Document how maintainers complete Dependabot PRs under the version policy.
- Record the DevBot 2.12.1 rollout on schema 004, the officer-chat review destination, the first approved unverified-visitor application, and the queue-logging follow-up it exposed.
- Add a unit test that keeps the Bun runtime pins and the CI/Compose PostgreSQL images in agreement, run the version check last in the CI checks job so dependency PRs report its other steps first, add an advisory `bun audit` workflow, comment GHCR write grants, and add a security policy that routes reports to private vulnerability reporting.

## 2.12.1 — Release handoff and future roadmap

- Record the next-session handoff with verified merged/published/deployed versions, DevBot identities and read-only health/persistence observations, policy decisions, and implementation pointers.
- Refresh the v2 release checklist after PR #6 and its image publication completed; retain the outstanding migration, live acceptance, operational features, recovery, and production cutover work.
- Document the owner's v3–v6 roadmap: rank-aware dashboard, interactive actions/reaction roles, ModMail, and expanded Lodestone profiles after v2 is settled and online.
- Link the handoff and roadmap from the README and synchronize the maintenance version in the startup plan and App Platform template.

## 2.12.0 — Officer-reviewed guest application forms

- Open `/apply` as a two-question modal for unverified visitors, with immediate form acknowledgement and freshly authenticated submissions bound to the user, guild, and current join.
- Persist bounded introduction/interest answers, submission audit, and review outbox atomically in additive migration `004_guest_application_form.sql`; repeated submissions retain the original pending application and answers.
- Show escaped answers beside persistent officer Approve/Deny buttons, including restart and deleted-message repair. Keep answers out of ordinary status/decision replies and distinguish legacy reviews without form answers.
- Preserve automatic verified non-FC Guest access, FC Member precedence, denial cooldown, explicit revocation, and existing grants. Verification while a form is pending supersedes manual approval.
- Cover real SDK acknowledgement/rendering, forged/stale context, concurrent decisions, persistence/rollback, cooldown, and registered-visitor behavior; update the live application-review test plan.

## 2.11.1 — Bound channel reconciliation reads

- Reuse a single captured channel session per reconciliation instead of force-fetching the guild and complete channel list for every target.
- Use the connected Gateway cache for no-op detection and protected binding/parent fences, with targeted REST reads before and after changed-channel writes.
- Keep full initial/final inventory verification, with at most one additional catalogue check before lowering the shared everyone default.
- Add a real application/SDK/PostgreSQL request-count regression for an 82-channel managed guild, plus disconnected/missing-scope safety coverage.

## 2.11.0 — DigitalOcean App Platform deployment

- Add a GHCR-backed App Platform spec with one bot worker, internal Nodestone service, pre-deploy migration job, and a newly provisioned inline PostgreSQL 18 dev database.
- Bind database credentials and the provider CA at runtime; enforce certificate/hostname verification when `DATABASE_CA_CERT` is supplied, including over conflicting URL TLS flags.
- Validate the provider schema offline in CI and test release/credential/networking invariants and actual driver TLS option parsing.
- Document initial provisioning, secrets, command registration, dev-database limits, and phased single-writer updates with persistent database identity.

## 2.10.2 — Separate officer chat from community channels

- Exclude Discord's configured community-updates channel and its parent category from onboarding preflight, selection, snapshots, and permission writes, using IDs rather than channel names.
- Prefer/create `#officer-chat` as the separate officer room and reject reserved resources as onboarding bindings.
- Recheck protected scope before remote mutations and react to community binding changes. Preserve the everyone visibility default where changing it would affect an excluded area.
- Verify reserved-channel privacy and limited-permission setup with SDK, PostgreSQL, and read-only DevBot preflight checks; record the new live officer room.

## 2.10.1 — Preserve explicit channel privacy

- Treat any explicit View Channel deny as private-area evidence when everyone, Member, and Guest visibility are all absent, including role and member-specific denies after onboarding is enabled.
- Keep a channel with no visibility overwrites distinguishable as an ordinary default-closed channel.
- Add SDK-effective and PostgreSQL regressions covering Member, Guest, other-role, and member-specific privacy; retain the first snapshot and prevent Member/Guest grants.

## 2.10.0 — Lobby onboarding and channel access

- Extend `/setup` to create/reuse a newcomer lobby and officer room, with explicit channel selections and manager/channel permission checks.
- Enforce lobby, Member/Guest, and staff-only visibility across all non-thread channel types; threads inherit parent visibility. Officers and FC Leaders can see the lobby while ordinary Members/Guests cannot.
- Preserve first-observed channel permissions/parents and the original everyone permission bitfield; retain existing private areas as staff-only. Persist the opt-in policy in `003_guild_access.sql` using Drizzle.
- Reconcile channel creation, edits, deletion, startup, refresh, and role rebinding through durable, revision-fenced work with full readback and no-op convergence.
- Derive Guest access for trusted registered non-FC visitors, preserving revocation, FC Member precedence, stale-evidence safeguards, and guild isolation.
- Verify effective Discord.js permissions, provisioning/reuse, partial-failure recovery, snapshot durability, authorization, refresh accounting, and visitor access transitions.

## 2.9.0 — Drizzle persistence

- Map the existing PostgreSQL schema with Drizzle ORM and use typed queries for application persistence.
- Preserve exact external IDs, bigint money, UTC timestamps, and database-enforced invariants.
- Bind ORM operations to the same connection as transactional decisions and PostgreSQL locks.
- Retain the applied SQL migrations and explicit PostgreSQL-specific control statements.
- Convert roster/rank projection, role setup, gateway observations, work leases/outbox, capability metrics, import, and maintenance commands to the shared ORM boundary.
- Derive persisted record contracts from the mapped schema and verify mapping parity, scalar JSON, transaction isolation/rollback, and concurrent queue fencing against PostgreSQL.

## 2.8.4 — Dependabot maintenance

- Enable weekly Bun dependency-update pull requests.
- Keep dependency updates subject to the existing SemVer, changelog, CI, and CodeQL requirements before merge.

## 2.8.3 — Release publication review fixes

- Isolate publication and reusable verification by commit SHA so new merges cannot cancel an older version's image builds.
- Serialize only the mutable latest-tag promotion, retaining its current-main guard.
- Reject build metadata and oversized release versions instead of silently changing or colliding Docker tags.

## 2.8.2 — CodeQL and project licensing

- Analyze JavaScript/TypeScript and GitHub Actions workflows with CodeQL, including the repository's required security/code-quality results.
- License first-party TaruBot code under AGPL-3.0-only; include the license in runtime images and OCI metadata.
- Add source-code and license links to `/version` output.

## 2.8.1 — Cross-platform test startup budgets

- Give subprocess and parser-worker tests bounded startup headroom under ARM64 emulation.
- Preserve all module, parser, transport-spacing, and cancellation assertions while avoiding the default five-second test deadline for cold worker startup.

## 2.8.0 — Pull-request CI and published containers

- Validate PRs with version/changelog checks, source checks, the full PostgreSQL-backed test suite, and both multi-platform container builds.
- Generate an invented CI migration fixture while retaining the separate supplied-dump acceptance path.
- Build and publish TaruBot and Nodestone images to GHCR after `main` changes pass verification, using latest, SemVer, and full-commit tags.
- Default Compose to registry images; retain an explicit local source-build override and development database overlay.
- Adopt the feature-branch, PR, passing-CI, merge-to-main workflow.

## 2.7.1 — Versioning policy and delivery readiness

- Require an appropriate SemVer increment for every coherent change set, including documentation, tests, and maintenance.
- Present required Discord intents and bot permissions as name/reason tables in the setup guide.
- Record the requirements-backed implementation gaps, live acceptance checks, and production-delivery work in `docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md`.
- Record live version-command registration and GitHub signature/history verification.

## 2.7.0 — Version and GitHub history command

- Add `/version [commits]` for any human guild member; show five commits by default, up to ten.
- Show the installed SemVer, linked short commit IDs, and commit titles.
- Mark signed commits with **✅** only when GitHub reports a valid verified signature.
- Share/cache bounded GitHub requests, and retain version output during GitHub outages or rate limits.

## Increment policy

- **Major:** incompatible changes to supported commands, configuration, or persisted-data contracts.
- **Minor:** backward-compatible functionality and supported operational capabilities.
- **Patch:** backward-compatible corrections or maintenance, including documentation, tests, and tooling changes without a new feature contract.
- Every coherent change set receives an appropriate version increment; related edits share that increment.

Future changes update `package.json`, the Bun-generated lockfile when affected, and this changelog together. Released versions identify the running build; the latest GitHub commits can include work newer than that build.
